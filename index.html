                <p>The discovery of a life-saving treatment for diabetes at the University of Toronto in 1921 made
                    headlines
                    worldwide and was formally acknowledged just two years later when the Nobel Prize for Medicine was
                    awarded to two of the team members. An illustrated timeline of the most significant events that led
                    to
                    the discovery and initial dissemination of insulin is provided here, and the full story with

                </h5>
                <p>In 2022, U of T researchers were able to develop the first bioartificial model of a key part of the
                    heart. Sargol Okhovatian and Mohammad Hossein Mohammadi, from the Faculty of Applied Science &
                    Engineering, were able to develop a smaller, to-scale version of the heart’s left ventricle, made
                    from living tissue and cells and capable of pumping a small amount of blood through a bioreactor.

                    These lab-grown models, with such accuracy, offer a new way to study a wide range of cardiovascular
                    conditions, and could open up potential avenues for therapies treating heart conditions. Miniature
                    models such as the one developed by Okhovatian and Mohammadi could allow researchers to study cell
                    function, tissue function, and overall organ function, without the need for any invasive procedures.
